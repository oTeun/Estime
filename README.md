# Estime
A free minecraft name sniper based on sockets

## To Do
- ~~Change account to custom skin on successful snipe, set in config~~
- More config options (maybe)
- Successful discord webhook to a webhook URL set in config
- A way to send webhooks in Teun's lobby without it being griefed (such as the way MCsniperPY does it)
- ~~Microsoft giftcode sniper~~
- Microsoft namechange sniper
- Queue multiple names at once, or from a list (from my /upcoming endpoint)

## How to use
- If you want to snipe with a giftcode, put the token of the account in tokens,txt
- If you want to snipe with a mojang account, put the account combo in accounts.txt as follows: email:password. If you have security questions on your account, put the answers behind the combo divided by colons just like the email and password
